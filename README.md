# Scraping Text

Here are two text scraping templates for you to experiment with. These run in Google co-lab notebook and will run in the browser. You will need a google login to run them.

[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jk_VHS-UzZLcQnJ64lqe6aA0_mAE7QwU#scrollTo=Lh6LiFe34bq4) contains two examples:

1. Scraping text off a page. For example, get all the `h3` header tags from a subreddit.
2. Scraping text from an autocomplete field, for example Bing or Amazon search.


Before you scrape you may wish to read this [brief intro to HTML/CSS](html-css.md).
